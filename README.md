# Capstone_Wrangled

Raw data needs to be cleaned and wrangled into a form you can analyze. Here are a few suggested steps:
1. Clean up your column names to be simple, short and descriptive
2. For each column:
  a. Check for missing values and decide what you want to do about them.
  b. Make sure the values in each column make sense. If you find values that don't, decide what you want to do about those.
  c. Look for outliers (values that are too small or too large). Do they make sense? Do you want to keep them in the data set?
3. Discuss with your mentor about other data wrangling steps you might need to perform for your specific problem and implement those.
4. Save your cleaned up and transformed data set.

## Submission

We ask you to submit a short report outlining your data wrangling steps. This report will eventually become part of your milestone report for your Capstone.
1. Add your cleaned-up data set to the github repository for your project.
2. Summarize the most important steps you took in cleaning up your data in a short (1 page max) document. You may use any format of your choice (R Markdown, Google Docs, Word etc).
3. Add this document to the github repository for your project.
