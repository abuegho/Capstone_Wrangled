### Renaming:
Most columns were aptly named, so there wasn't really much to be adjusted except the "Date Of Stop" and "Time Of Stop" columns; I went ahead and renamed them "Date" & "Time", respectively.

### NA & NONE Values:
Many variables have null values, but not all of them are critical enough to weigh negatively on the analysis. On the Other hand, "Description" had six missing values, which I went ahead and filtered out. 

"Make" also had many NA values, which indicates either that the car was unknown, or a vehicle was not involved in the violation. "Make" also had over 7000 thousand observations that was marked as **NONE**, which is most likely pedestrain violations, I am lead to such conclusion as most of these violations have been registered by "Foot Patrol"
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Traffic_Violations%>% 
  filter(Traffic_Violations$Make == "NONE")%>% 
  select(Description, Make, `Arrest Type`)
```
